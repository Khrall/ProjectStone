#Unit#

<sup>[Description](#description) | [Pseudo-code](#pseudo-code)</sup>

###Description###

The Unit class will be far more complicated than the one provided here, but we do not need it to be in order to fulfill the potential of the Battle class. It holds healthpoints and manapoints and possesses attributes and skills. Of course, each unit also needs a name.

###Pseudo-code###

  ```java
  int hp, mp, attack, defense, etc ..
  list availableabilities
  string name
  
  //TODO: Create constructor, simply assigns attributes, available abilities and name
  ```
