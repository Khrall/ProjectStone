###Description###

The Player class will not play a big role in the Battle, however the player's name and attribute bonuses should affect the combat system in terms of presentation and calculations.

###Pseudo-code###

  ```java
  int bonusAttack, bonusDefense, etc ..
  string name
  
  //TODO: Create constructor, simply assigns attributes, available abilities and name
  ```
