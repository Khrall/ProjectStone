#Player#

###Description###

The Player is really made to organize what a player in the game can and cannot do. For example, the Player object holds information on what city the player holds and what units it can controll. Also, it holds bonuses/attribute boosts that will affect the units' behavior both on the map, and in battle, as well as a 'speed', which determines if this or that player is going to start the battle.


###Pseudo-code###

  ```Java
  City home
  list units
  int attackBonus, defenceBonus, speed, movementBonus, etc ...

  //TODO: Constructor, assigns variables
  ```
