#Tile#

###Description###

The Tile class is quite sophisticated. It holds its own position on the map as a coordinate (x, y), but also holds a list of objects placed on it. It provides functions that calculate whether the tile is navigable, and what action should be made upon click.

###Pseudo-code###

  ```Java
  //TODO: Get this class going!
  ```
