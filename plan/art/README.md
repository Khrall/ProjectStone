#Art development#

###Description###

The art development is quite substantial, and of course incredibly important for the end-product to be attractive for users. Therefore, a lot of energy will be put in creating good-looking sprites both for the in-game elements and the graphical user interface.

We want to implement a 32 x 32 pixel art style design to our in-game elements, since these are somewhat easier and faster to make. Making games look realistic is really hard when working off of the native Java Applet, which is why this is a much more suited solution.

The graphical user interface will be implemented with different types of panels, menus and buttons created for interaction both with the technicalities of the game, and of course within the game itself. The style of the graphical user interface should be quite consistent, but there is always room for deviations in terms of different shapes and sizes, and of course in terms of differently looking icons.
