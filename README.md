#Project Stone#

This is a game development project going by the name of “Project Stone”, a hand-in assignment from the programming course TDT4100 at NTNU, Trondheim. Its main focus is on being a crossover between the classical tactical role-playing and the turn-based strategy genre, featuring multiplayer gameplay. The project is due 24th of April, but will most likely be revised further later on and hopefully updated frequently when “finished”.

##1. Basics##

###1.1 Objective###

Each player will control a character capable of moving around on the map and interacting with the surroundings, and a city to protect and manage. The objective of the game will be to occupy all other players cities, a task carried out by the characters. 

###1.2 Surroundings###

The game is created on the fundament of tiles, the map consisting of a grid of these. Each tile will hold different kinds of objects:
-  Inanimate objects, such as texture and obstacles
-	Interactive objects, such as resources, items and strategic points
-	Units, such as the players’ characters and NPCs

###1.3 Interactivity###

Interaction in the game mainly revolves around moving the character in order to gather resources, pick up items and engage with enemies in battle. This will be done instinctively simply by clicking your destination tile, initiating movement towards it. If the tile holds an interactive object, the player will interact with it upon moving over it [the tile].

However, many actions can only be done through the graphical user interface, providing possibilities of managing a city, leading a battle and even selecting objects for inspection (all objects except inanimate ones).
