#Battle#

In a battle, two players engage with their units in combat. The two players will take turns in making moves in order to defeat the opponent by killing all its units. Each player engages with a maximum of three units:

| Player 1  | Player 2  |
|:---------:|:---------:|
| Unit 1    | Unit 1    |
| Unit 2    | Unit 2    |
| Unit 3    | Unit 3    |

The attacker wil commence the battle, and starts by ordering his first unit to perform a *BattleAction*. Each unit has its own set of *BattleAbilities*, so the player will have to choose both an ability and targets for the ability in order to create the BattleAction.

For each unit, the player must:
1. Choose an ability
2. Pick targets to affect
